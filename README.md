Welcome to "Notenote". 


I built this app to refresh my memory & remember how to build apps using rails & ruby. It took me about 4 hours to build the app. It was fun! 

If you would like to build it, you should checkout MacKenzie's youtube channel. 

Gems: 
Devise 
Haml 

Notes: 
<li> The haml gem is a pain. I would recommend the use of Sublime instead of Atom. haml seems to work better with Sublime. </li>
<li> Be careful with the tabs in your code. Make sure you have a clean code.</li>
2/ The CSS code didn't work well for me. I had to change it a little in the banner element.  

#banner {
	background-image: url(image_path("welcome_banner_image.jpg"));
	background-size: cover;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-position: top center;
	width: 100%;
	min-height: 500px;
	display: table;
	color: white;
	text-align: center; 

}
