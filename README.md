This app is called "Notenote"

I followed the tutorial of MacKenzie Child & picked different colors from the design. It took me about 4 hours to build the app. It was fun! 

If you would like to build it, you should checkout MacKenzie's youtube channel. 

Gems: 
Devise 
Haml 

Notes: 
1/The haml gem is a pain. First, I would recommend Sublime as the text editor, second, always use tab, & be careful with the tabulation. If the tabulation is wrong, you will get error message. 
2/ The CSS code didn't work well for me. I had to change it a little in the banner element.  

#banner {
	background-image: url(image_path("welcome_banner_image.jpg"));
	background-size: cover;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-position: top center;
	width: 100%;
	min-height: 500px;
	display: table;
	color: white;
	text-align: center; 

}
